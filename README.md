Quantitative Analysis of CAPM and Fama-French Three-Factor Model
Project Overview:
This GitHub repository presents "Group Project 3," a quantitative analysis project that rigorously applies the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Fama-French Three-Factor Model to two distinct companies: Ford Motor Company (large-cap) and AtriCure Inc. (small-cap). The project emphasizes numerical analysis and statistical methods to draw comparisons and conclusions about these companies.

Key Features:

Data-Driven Company Analysis: The project undertakes a data-centric approach, analyzing Ford, with its high book-to-market ratio, and AtriCure Inc., characterized by a low book-to-market ratio.
CAPM Analysis: In-depth statistical analysis using CAPM to calculate the expected returns of the stocks, accounting for market risk (beta) and comparing it against the market premium.
Fama-French Model Application: Extends the analysis by incorporating size and value factors, quantitatively measuring their impact on stock performance.
Statistical Comparisons: Employs regression models, beta calculations, and risk-return metrics to compare and contrast the investment profiles of the two companies.
Quantitative Analysis and Results:

Ford Analysis: Utilizes CAPM to quantitatively assess Ford's market risk and expected returns, indicating lower volatility and risk due to its market capitalization and book-to-market ratio.
AtriCure Inc. Analysis: Examines the small-cap characteristics of AtriCure Inc. using both models, highlighting its distinct risk-return profile compared to larger companies.
Conclusion:
The project's quantitative analysis provides a nuanced understanding of how different company sizes and market valuations affect stock performance as per CAPM and Fama-French models. It demonstrates the practical utility of these models in a real-world investment context, offering valuable insights for academic, investment, and financial research purposes.

Technical Details:

Models Used: Capital Asset Pricing Model and Fama-French Three-Factor Model.
Analysis Techniques: Regression analysis, beta calculation, risk-return assessment.
Focus Companies: Ford Motor Company and AtriCure Inc.
Future Scope:
The project can be expanded to include a more diverse range of companies and sectors, or to integrate additional financial models and statistical methods for a comprehensive market analysis.
